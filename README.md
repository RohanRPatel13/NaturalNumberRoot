# NaturalNumberRoot

## Objectives
1. Familiarity with using NaturalNumber objects and methods.
2. Familiarity with using interval halving to invert a function.

## The Problem
Your job is to implement the root static method for NaturalNumber using the interval halving root algorithm you developed in an earlier homework and lab for integer roots.
